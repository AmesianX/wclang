Wclang is a tool which helps you to cross compile source code easily with clang on linux for windows.
Wclang is basically a wrapper for clang, which allows you to directly target windows.
Wclang detects the target and headers automaticly and adds them to the clang invocation command.

After the installation you will have "w32-clang", "w32-clang++", "w64-clang" and "w64-clang++" available as "compiler".

PREREQUISITES:

 A C++11 compiler for compiling the wrapper (g++ 4.6+, clang)
 clang (3.1+)
 mingw-w64 with its headers and libs

INSTALLATION:

 ./bootstrap.sh
 ./configure
 make
 make install

EXAMPLES:

 w32-clang++ hello-world.cpp -o hello-world.exe && wine hello-world
 CC=w32-clang ./configure --host=`w32-clang -wc-target`

LISTING AVAILABLE PARAMETERS:
 w32-clang -wc-help
